# Official Cindrmon's Config Files v2.0

This is my official cindrmon's config files remade for pure refactoring and cleansing of all the messy dotfiles I currently have on my system, and had backed it up over here!

New version will not contain stowing anymore, as the file structure is remade to almosot closely follow what it would look like in the `~` directory. There might be no future plans yet to create a script that works similar to `stow`, so everything in this repository is entirely copy-paste only. 

The [wiki](https://gitlab.com/cindrmon/cindrmons-config-files/-/wikis/home) is still available for Arch Linux installation and other stuff.
