# Official Cindrmon's Config Files v2.0

This is my official cindrmon's config files remade for pure refactoring and cleansing of all the messy dotfiles I currently have on my system, and had backed it up over here!

~~New version will not contain stowing anymore, as the file structure is remade to almosot closely follow what it would look like in the `~` directory. There might be no future plans yet to create a script that works similar to `stow`, so everything in this repository is entirely copy-paste only.~~

I just recently reverted back to stowing, since managing dotFiles that are not symlinked is hard, especially when you go back and forth between files just to modify it. So, stowing is on the table now.

The [wiki](https://gitlab.com/cindrmon/cindrmons-config-files/-/wikis/home) is still available for Arch Linux installation and other stuff.
