# cindrmon's pacstrap-cont script
#
# Do you ever get frustrated from constantly retrying pacstrap because
# your internet is goddamn slow, and it would frequently 'Request Time Out'
# when bootstrapping your packages? Well, this is the script for you!
# 
# It will constantly pacstrap n times or until pacstrap has finally completed
# without exiting with any errors or 'Request Timed Out'
#
# TODO: Figure out the 'request timed out' return code
#

#!/bin/bash
